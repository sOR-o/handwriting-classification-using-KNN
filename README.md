# handwriting-classification-using-KNN
This project is using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm! This repository is about image classification and KNN through hands-on experience with the MNIST dataset.
In this project, process of classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. First data preprocessing, move on to implementing the KNN algorithm from scratch, and finally, evaluate our model's performance.

**Getting Started**
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies : `pip install -r req.txt`
3. Open the jupyter lab : `jupyter lab`

Can be improved by transfer learning (obviously ðŸ˜‰)
